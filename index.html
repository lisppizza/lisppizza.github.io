<h2>Lisp in Several Pizzas: A Secret Alien Pizza Club</h2>
<p>There's no shortage of successful tech meetups these days, especially in larger cities. For less than "hot" topics, however, it can be a challenge to get going, and fill speaking slots each month. This Lisp Pizza Club doesn't try to do that. Instead, we meet up and eat pizza together, conversing about the Lisp family of languages, and whatever else strikes our fancy (as they say). The only thing necessary is an <em>interest</em> in one or more of Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Arc, Emacs Lisp, Dylan, Fennel, or any of the hundreds of related languages calling themselves "of Lisp."</p>
